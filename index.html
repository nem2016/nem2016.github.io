  	A group of passionate and dedicated students entered into OACETT&#8217;s National Engineering Month competition and celebration last year.
  	The focus of the event was DNA as a Future Storage Device, and was presented by who presented on the topic of DNA as a Storage Device.
  	The turnout was excellent and everyone who attended loved it and learned a lot.

      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body"><p>What&#8217;s your passion? We can tell you ours! Some of us love Robots.  Some of us love living organisms.
      We&#8217;re fascinated by viruses, bacteriophages, and synthetic biology.  We&#8217;re fascinated by the minute and the micro.
      Some of us are fascinated by medical devices and cancer and human tissues.
      Some of us work with bacteria while some of us work with engines and gears or code.
      It&#8217;s highly likely that one of us will be influenced by what another of us is learning about.
      We&#8217;re not just in our program because it&#8217;s our favorite thing, we&#8217;re likely here because it&#8217;s practical,
      because there&#8217;s some application for it that will help society, because there&#8217;s a demand for it in the job market.
      We might even be unsure as to why we are here, but we&#8217;re certainly learning along the way.
</p><p>We here at Centennial College have planned an event that is broad in scope.
Engineering is not limited to one field, it has many different sectors, so we have decided to celebrate its multidisciplinary nature.
Engineers keep us warm, safe, clean and healthy.  They provide systems that heat and cool air during different seasons,
design and build walls and lighting systems that provide shelter and visibility,
they figure out the mechanisms that allow us to filter water and air and they create systems that keep us healthy,
from blow dryers and sanitation systems to advanced medical technologies.  We want to say thank you.  We hope to learn more from you.
We hope to contribute and better society too.  The multidisciplinary nature of engineering has created, overall, a better society.

      <div class="panel-body"><p>Naturally, for us as students, the goal of National Engineering Month is encompassed in the idea of learning.
      We like to soak up as much as we can, while we can.  The opportunity to learn outside the classroom is appealing.
      It can be different and refreshing, and we aren&#8217;t marked on it!
</p><p>However, while we learn and share our own knowledge, we would also like to make this event practical and beneficial for the community in another way.
We have invited the charity Let&#8217;s Talk Science to National Engineering Month, and we will be raising money for this worthy charity.
Is there a better way to encourage youth to partake in science than by supporting an organization that specializes in that already?
It was a hard choice as there are so many worthy causes &#8211; but we think this charity fits with our theme.
</p><p>Simply put, our goals are: Awareness, education, and raising money towards this goal.</p>

   	They act as a third party organization that provides certification to Engineering Technologists and Technicians,
   	encourages continued learning, and holds members to ethical code of conduct.
   	OACETT is hosting the National Engineering Month College Challenge competition, which is province wide.
   	By hosting a competition OACETT has created the incentive to &#8220;go big or go home&#8221;.
   	This encouragement to go big means that colleges who rise to the challenge will reach more people and community members,
   	more effectively, and in the end, if this is the result &#8211; everybody wins!

  	<p>We are students and engineering enthusiasts in different programs, working hard, while balancing school, social lives,
  	and work to organize National Engineering Month.  We are working alongside numerous excited volunteers and participants.
  	We are a diverse group of students enrolled in different programs that include Advanced Biotechnology, Food Science, Software Engineering,
  	Automation & Robotics, Construction Management, Mechanical Engineering, Nursing, Business Foundations, Biomedical Engineering Technology
  	and Project Management.  We are club organizers and club members, friends, coffee drinkers and coffee avoiders, technophiles, religious and atheist.
  	We come from all different walks of life, and we have united together to celebrate Engineering!
</p><p>We have had immeasurable help from numerous faculty members and administrators at Centennial College.  This has been a learning experience for us all,
and we are pleased to strengthen our bonds with you as we learn about the process involved in planning a major event.
It has been fun, hard work, requiring late nights and early mornings, at times trying, and always rewarding.
We can only hope that we will be passing on a legacy to future students,
and that the National Engineering Month celebration will become a tradition at Centennial College.

  	<p>On March 26, 2014 @ 6:30 am - 9:30 pm Centennial College students hosted a speaker - Michael Liang, PhD Student, University of Toronto, Department of Molecular Genetics in celebration of
  	National Engineering Month and as part of OACETT&#8217;s College Challenge.
</p><p>&#8220;Since its discovery in 1953, DNA has been the topic of discussion in the scientific community.
In 2013 a breakthrough in the area of using DNA as a storage device was achieved.
The experiments done revealed that large amount of global data (close to 3 Zeta bytes &#8211; including audio, video, picture, literature files),
can be successfully stored in a single DNA strand, in a highly secure, cost efficient and long lasting manner.&#8221;
</p><p>The event followed a theatre style presentation delivered by two guest speakers with the use of a Powerpoint Presentation,
their message was reinforced through sharing their real life experiences, and by answering the queries of the audience.

  	<p>Centennial College of Applied Arts and Technology, located in Toronto, has four campuses in the Eastern GTA.
  	Centennial College was the first college to be established in Ontario under the direction of the Minister of Education, the Honorable William Davis.
  	It is a culturally diverse school that offers over 150 unique degree, diploma,
  	certificate and apprenticeship programs with an emphasis on global awareness and critical thinking.
  	Each of the four campuses specializes in a different set of programs.  Programs include business, communications, applied computing,
  	health sciences, music, animation theatre, film and design and engineering technology.
</p><p>In addition to wonderful staff and faculty that work hard daily to teach, support and inspired,
Centennial College makes great effort to foster community through the CCSAI, the Centennial College Student Association,
which oversees Clubs and activities.
Awareness, friendships and activism are encouraged through student led events which offer networking opportunities,
as well as opportunities to improve leadership and team-work skills.
